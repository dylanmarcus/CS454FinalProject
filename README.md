RUN IN PYTHON 3

To run the sequitur algorithm, run "sequitur.py" using python3.
Choose out of the 3 input files to compress.
Verbose mode will print out the grammar at each iteration to see the algorithm working.
The starting rule along with an encoded grammer (encoded by extrapolating the right-hand side of each rule separated with a '#' as per the paper).
The performance score is the lenght of the original input divided by the total lenght of compressed output (starting rule + encoded grammar).

run
```
python3 encoder.py
```
to test re-pair algorithm
the test prints the rules from first
rule to the last rule
followed by the compression ration
