RUN IN PYTHON 3

To run the sequitur algorithm, run "sequitur.py" using python3.
Choose out of the 3 input files to compress.
Verbose mode will print out the grammar at each iteration to see the algorithm working.
The starting rule along with an encoded grammer (encoded by extrapolating the right-hand side of each rule separated with a '#' as per the paper).
The performance score is the lenght of the original input divided by the total lenght of compressed output (starting rule + encoded grammar).


To run the repair algorithm, run "repair.py" using python3.
REPAIR IS NOT FULLY FUNCTIONING.
It will print out its states as it is working, but will fail.
